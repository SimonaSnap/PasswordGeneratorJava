# PasswordGeneratorJava

GitHub Page:

Description:

This is a password generator. Once the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, they are asked how long they want the password to be as well as what type of characters they want in that password. Types include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The program then generates a password that contains at least one of each type selected and presents it in the box, as well as logs it to the console.

What I learned:

Functions can be a lot larger than I thought
 - I need to start finding a way to track what blocks go into the code
 - How do I visualize what I am making?

I learned how to write code that makes a random result

How to get input from a user through things like prompt and confirm

How to write code that appends information conditionally to a new place

How to make a function that loops through only a portion
 - the makePassword function sets i to finalPassword.length - this length changes depending on how many cateogries have already been appended to the finalPassword array earlier, the function would then continue to run until it reaches the number of desired numbers as inputed by the user
